# Design Decisions for Employee Management API Project

## Overview

This document outlines the key architectural and design decisions made during the development of the Employee Management API project.

---

## 1. Framework & Tools

- **Django & Django REST Framework (DRF)**  
  Chosen for rapid development, built-in ORM, and robust REST API support. DRF provides easy serialization, authentication, and pagination out-of-the-box.

- **SQLite (default Django DB)**  
  Used initially for simplicity and faster setup during development and testing. PostgreSQL can be integrated later for production or scalability needs.

- **Faker Library**  
  Utilized to generate synthetic employee and attendance data to simulate a realistic dataset for testing and demonstration purposes.

- **drf-yasg**  
  Used for API documentation and interactive Swagger UI, facilitating easy API exploration and testing.

---

## 2. Database Design

- **Normalized Models**  
  Core entities such as Employee, Attendance, and Performance models are normalized to avoid redundancy and maintain data integrity.

- **Relationships**  
  - `ForeignKey` from Attendance and Performance to Employee establishes clear ownership.  
  - This enables efficient querying and aggregation of data by employee.

- **Fields**  
  Each model includes 7-8 fields capturing essential data points, balancing completeness and simplicity.

---

## 3. Authentication & Security

- **Token Authentication (DRF TokenAuth)**  
  Chosen for simplicity and stateless API usage. Tokens are generated via `/api/token/` endpoint and required for protected views.

- **Permission Classes**  
  Secured API endpoints use `IsAuthenticated` to ensure only authorized users access sensitive employee data.

---

## 4. API Design

- **RESTful APIs**  
  Endpoints follow REST principles, providing CRUD operations with pagination and filtering where applicable.

- **Pagination**  
  Implemented via DRF’s built-in pagination classes to handle large datasets and improve response times.

- **Filtering**  
  Enables clients to query specific subsets of data (e.g., attendance by employee).

---

## 5. Data Visualization

- **Frontend Template with Chart.js**  
  Integrated a simple Django-rendered template to visualize aggregated attendance data using Chart.js.

- **Separation of Concerns**  
  Backend API serves raw data; frontend handles rendering charts, keeping each part modular and maintainable.

---

## 6. Rate Limiting & Throttling

- **DRF Throttle Classes**  
  Applied to limit API request rates, preventing abuse and ensuring fair resource usage.

---

## 7. Development Workflow

- **Version Control with Git**  
  Commits made regularly with meaningful messages for easy tracking and collaboration.

- **Modular Code Structure**  
  Django apps organized under `core/` with clearly defined models, serializers, views, and urls.

- **Scalability Considerations**  
  Though starting with SQLite, models and code are designed to smoothly transition to PostgreSQL or other databases.

---

## Summary

The architecture balances rapid development, maintainability, security, and scalability. It leverages Django’s ecosystem to provide a robust foundation for employee data management and visualization, with scope for future feature additions and improvements.
